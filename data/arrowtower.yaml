# level 0 is used for base stats and info, it is ignored by game logic
# All stats is applied on lower level, e.g. all stats from level 1 is
# carried over to level 2 unless overridden.
# Engine assumes levels are in order and sequential (it is mostly an aid
# writing config, not really used by engine.
